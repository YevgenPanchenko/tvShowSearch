# tvShowSearch
Hi everyone! This is my Desktop version of Search for tv Shows aplication. Written on JavaScript with Axios library and preventDefault method applied on eventListner. With some HTML and CSS styles.
Aplication uses tvMaze's API, and when a response is received from the API, the makeImages function is called with the response data as a parameter. This function iterates over the received data and creates HTML image elements for each TV show found in the response. If no image is found then no image HTML element is created.
All further responses to the user's request will be published on the same page. If you do not want this, please reload the page and make your request.
Here's a [link](https://yevgenpanchenko.github.io/tvShowSearch/) to deployed version of this application!
Thank you for visiting!
